## 🤖 AI Windows Crash Analyzer
We’ve developed an **AI-powered crash analysis tool** that goes beyond simple error codes.  
Our analyzer can:
- 🧠 **Interpret Windows crash logs** (including BSODs) in plain English
- 📜 **Read and parse other software crash logs**
- 🔍 Identify **likely causes and solutions**
- 🚀 Provide **step-by-step troubleshooting advice** based on system context

**Why it’s different:**  
Instead of giving you vague stop codes, our tool understands logs in context, looking for **hardware, driver, or software conflicts** and translating them into **actionable solutions**.
